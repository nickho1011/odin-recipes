        <h2>Description</h2>
         <p>Sam the Cooking Guys' Carne Asada recipe is probably my <strong>most often</strong> made recipe out of all the food I cook. I use it for meal prep, I make it for my friends, it is my go to for barbecues. It is just so affordable, makes a large amount, and most importantly, it's <em>EASY</em></p>
         <p>The recipe can is a marinade for flap meat. It can be blended or prepared by hand. A little warning: if you blend it, prepare for some green meat.. But there is no harm in that right?</p>
