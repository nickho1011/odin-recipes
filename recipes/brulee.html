        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Bless Alton Brown. Need I say more? Okay, yes, maybe I do. To keep it short, Alton Brown (AB for short) was a huge part of my childhood and probably is the reason why I became so fascinated by cooking. Some kids watched Saturday morning cartoons... I watched AB. I thought his lame science-y jokes were so funny, and the way he talked about food was so different and much more realistic than other Food Network stars. Anyway, enough about my fascination with AB. Onto the recipe!</p>
        <p>Creme Brulee is now my family favorite. It is the dessert my parents fawn over and always request that I make. Actually it isn't just my family, my friends love it too! The simplicity of this recipe as well as how fast I can churn it out is what makes it appealing. Over the years I have tinkered with the different flavor options available out there. I have tried taro, I have tried matcha, I have tried thai tea. I actually have not tried coffee yet... maybe that will be my next endeavor. Anyway, this recipe comes together in under 20 minutes, and spends 45 minutes in the oven, and then sits in the fridge over night. You sprinkle some sugar on it, torch it up, and <em>Voila!</em>, you got delicious Creme Brulee that is certain to impress.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Quart (4 cups) Heavy Cream</li>
            <li>1 Vanilla bean, split and scraped [I personally use vanilla extract, 1-2 tsp should suffice]</li>
            <li>6 large egg yolks</li>
            <li>Hot water (*more info on this later)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F</li>
            <li>Combine the heavy cream, vanilla bean pod (extract) in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Make sure the temperature does not get too hold as it will cause the milk to scald (burn). Remove from the heat, cover, and allow to steep for 15 minutes. Remove the vanilla bean pod and reserve for another use.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, whistk together 1/2 cup of the [vanilla]sugar and the egg yolks until well blended and it just starts to lighten in color. Add the cream, a little at a time to prevent curdling (Process known as Tempering), stirring constantly.</li>
            <li>Pour the liquid into 6 (7-8oz) ramekins. Place the ramekins into a roasting pan with tall sidesa. Pour enough hot water into the pan to come halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Bake just until the creme brulee is set, but still trembling in the center, 40-45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the ramekins from the roasting pan and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up to 3 days. </li>
            <li>Remove the creme brulee from the refrigerator at least 30 minutes prior to serving. Sprinkle sugar on top of the creme brulee to create a layer. Use a torch to melt and burn the top, slowly rotating the ramekin so the sugar crust has full coverage</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>*Notes*</h3>
        <p>*The amount of hot water in the ingredients is arbitrary, it just depends on the size of the roasting pan</p>
        <p>**Tempering is slowly incorporating a hot liquid into eggs to slowly raise the temperature and to avoid curdling/cooking the eggs. Once about half of the cream mixture is incorporated into the eggs, you can pour the rest of the cream in without worry. If you are worried, feel free to use a wire mesh strainer before pouring in ramekens.</p>
