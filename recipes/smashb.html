        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>First of all, this website is <strong>PACKED</strong> with information. I won't even bother explaining, it is just worth the read.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 soft hamburger roll buttered and toasted (extra points for those fancy brioche buns)</li>
            <li>Condiments and toppings as desired, mayonnaise (kewpie anyone??), mustard, shredded lettuce, onions, tomatoes, and pickles</li>
            <li>4 oz (110g) 80/20 ground beef, divided into two 2oz (55g) balls</li>
            <li> Kosher salt and FRESHLY ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 slice cheese, kraft stands out.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <p><em>Disclaimer</em>: Kenji's recipe is pretty comprehensive and detailed. I will be summarizing it</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Butter and toast the bun.</li>
            <li>Preheat a pan over high heat for 2 minutes. Place balls of beef in pan and smash down. Smashed patties should be wider than burger bun.</li>
            <li>Season the top sides of the cooking patties. If you smash hard enough, the first side should take 45 seconds. Kenji uses a bench scraper, but use whatever you can to scrape the patties off the pan.</li>
            <li>Flip the patties and place a piece of cheese over 1 patty, or both if you like cheese.</li>
            <li>Once the cheese has melted, stack the 2nd patty on top of the cheese patty and place on garnished bun</li>
        </ol>
